soyutils.js as a RequireJS module
=================================

It's a soyutils.js from Google Closure Templates library, packaged as a RequireJS module.

I'm not adding, not removing anything from original soyutils.js (see `soyutils.origin.js`), just a repackaged
 version of the library.

I've split original library into smaller RequireJS modules (`src` dir), and made an optimized version as
  `soyutils.min.js`. You can make your own version by executing `build.sh`
